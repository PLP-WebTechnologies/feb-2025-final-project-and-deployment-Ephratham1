This is a placeholder file for the image directory.

In a real implementation, you would add the following image files to this directory:
- hero-image.jpg (for the hero section background)
- beef.jpg, lamb.jpg, chicken.jpg (for featured products)
- ribeye.jpg, sirloin.jpg, fillet.jpg, brisket.jpg (for beef products)
- lamb-chops.jpg, leg-of-lamb.jpg (for lamb products)
- chicken-breast.jpg, whole-chicken.jpg (for chicken products)
- pork-chops.jpg, pork-belly.jpg (for pork products)
- biltong.jpg, boerewors.jpg (for specialty products)
- butchery.jpg (for about page)
- team1.jpg, team2.jpg, team3.jpg (for team members)
- map.jpg (for the map placeholder)

For now, you can use placeholder images from services like https://placeholder.com or https://picsum.photos
